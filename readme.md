Taxer Importer
====

A simple program to get your financial records from bank, exported as csv into https://taxer.ua

## Installation

You might want to use virtualenv for installing this, or you can install required packages system-wide.

All in all the steps are dead-simple:
```
git clone https://github.com/sashasimkin/taxer-importer.git
cd taxer-importer/
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prerequisites & configuration

**You must have all your bank accounts used in statement added in taxer.ua in order for the script to work.**

You also need to do a few things:

1. Have account statement available as .csv
2. Specify your taxer credentials

### Bank account statement

Right now only the current format generated by monobank's fop web UI is supported.

I suggest placing them into project directory and name `book-{from}-{to}.csv`. That way they will also be ignored by git if you ever want to contribute to this project :wink: :wink:

### Specify credentials

You can pass the credentials  as `-e EMAIL` and `-p PASSWORD` on command line, on each invokation, but I suggest placing them in a file name `.taxer-credentials` in a form `email:password`.

This will will be read by the program automatically, the file  will also be ignored by git if you ever want to contribute to this project :wink: :wink:

## Usage

When you fulfilled all the prerequisites and configurations - run the script in dry run mode to confirm format is correct:

```bash
python3 mail.py {STATEMENT_FILE.csv} --dry-run
```

The run it regularly to import all your operaitons.

```bash
python3 mail.py {STATEMENT_FILE.csv}
```

Then you watch some output, and don't forget to compare your bank records in bank and taxer, just to be sure, you don't horsin' around taxation.

## Notes

The script imports currency exchange operations as non-taxable income. You might need to check if that's okay with your tax office subsidiary.
